<h1 class="bigtxt">Shuckle: The Mold Pokemon</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="code"><code>Look to these boxes for explanations of terminology, abbreviations, and other note's I'd like to add to the page. </code></div>
    <p>Easily, one of my favorite Pokemon. In the top ten without a second doubt. The overall design is simple, yet unique. It is said that Shuckle might be some sort of sentient mold inhabiting a meteorite, that in and of itself is pretty interesting. It's defense focused stats provides for a different style of combat than the standard hit-as-hard-as-you-can strategy proving that changing it up every now and then can prove fun and challanging.  Below I will be attempting to explain which mechanical aspects of Shuckle convinced me to place it in a spot on my team.</p>
<h2 id="Type" class="main-section">Type</h2>
    <div class="code"><code>In this section I will be using the terms "Neutral to, Weak against, and Resistant to. These correspond to to 1x, 2x, and 1/2x damage multipliers when recieving damage respectively.</code></div>    
    <h4>Bug and Rock type</h4>
    <p>Bug-type is known as a bit of an outlier in terms of poplarity, due too generally not having too stellar HP and defense stats in general -- known for being quite squishy (as bugs are). However, despite is's shortcomings in attacking it has fairly balanced type matchups. This is where Shuckle stands apart in many ways.</p>
    <p>On the other side of the coin, Rock-type is known for generally having decient attack and high defense stat. Unfortunately, it is beset by having common weakness, despite having a balanced type-matchup. This is also where Shuckle seems to break the mold set out by it's typing.</p>
    <p>The combination of Bug-type and Rock-type nullifies most of the weaknesses and resistances (making them neutral) of both, undeniably for the better. Shuckle proves that unlikely type-matchup, even contradictory ones, can prove advantageous.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Neutral to: Fighting, Flying, Ground, Bug, Ghost, Fire, Grass, Electric, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, Dark, and Fairy</li>
        <li>Weak against: Rock, Steel, and Water</li>
        <li>Resistant against: Normal and Poison</li>
    </ul>    
<h2 id="Stats" class="main-section">Stats</h2>
    <div class="code"><code>I'm going to use some abbreviations in this section, so to make sure you're not confused lets break them down real quick: HP = Health Points,  Atk = Attack, Def = Defense, Sp. Atk = Special Atk, Sp. Def = Special Def, and Spd = Speed. Furthermore, the difference between min and max stats is EV training and perfect IVs.</code></div>    
    <p>Shuckle's stats are what make him the powerhouse he is, atleast in terms of defense and stalling a match, boasting a meaty def and sp. def allowing him to take even super-effective hits as a mere glancing blow. This is further compounded by EV training his HP and Atk stats making him capable of mounting a moderate counter-attack while stalling during a poison-stall or delivering stat-debuffs before switching to a more atk focused pokemon. His spd stat is so low that you're almost always guaranteed the 2nd attack, which might seem detrimental, but combined with certain moves that boost damage if hit first in the same turn it can turn advantageous.</p> 
    <h4>Min. Stats(At max level)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>HP: 150</li>
        <li>Atk: 22</li>
        <li>Def: 418</li>
        <li>Sp. Atk: 22</li>
        <li>Sp. Def: 418</li>
        <li>Spd: 13</li>
    <p> Not stellar for anything but defense in the standard Shuckle, but below are the stats of an optimized Shuckle:
    </ul>
    <h4>Max Stats(At max level)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>HP: 244</li>
        <li>Atk: 130</li>
        <li>Def: 614</li>
        <li>Sp. Atk: 130</li>
        <li>Sp. Def: 614</li>
        <li>Spd: 119</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once again, not stellar for anything but defense, but if utilized properly Shuckle can be formidable roadblock on your opponents path to victory and a game-slowing moment of respite on your path to victory.</p>
    <h4>My Shuckle(at level 79)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>HP: 192</li>
        <li>Atk: 89</li>
        <li>Def: 401</li>
        <li>Sp. Atk: 43</li>
        <li>Sp. Def: 394</li>
        <li>Spd: 39</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Having EV trained and bred for perfect IVs, my Shuckle is well on it's way to becoming an optimal Shuckle. I foucsed a little extra on the HP and Atk stats to give him a bit more of a punch while drawing matches out.</p>
